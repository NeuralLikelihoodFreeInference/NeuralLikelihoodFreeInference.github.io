This page is maintained by [Lorenzo Pacchiardi](https://lorypack.github.io/). The website is generated from [this repository](https://github.com/NeuralLikelihoodFreeInference/NeuralLikelihoodFreeInference.github.io), which is a fork of [this other repository](https://github.com/ScoreBasedGenerativeModeling/scorebasedgenerativemodeling.github.io). 

## Contribute

If you want to contribute a new entry to the list, you can either comment below in the main page and I will take care of it, or, if you feel like doing that directly yourself:
  
- fork the [Github repository](https://github.com/NeuralLikelihoodFreeInference/NeuralLikelihoodFreeInference.github.io),
- add an entry to the `entries.json` file (following the structure of one of the other elements),
- run the script `./generate_index.sh` (which converts the list of entries stored in the `entries.json` file to the `html` source via a python script),
- commit the changes
- and then open a pull request.
