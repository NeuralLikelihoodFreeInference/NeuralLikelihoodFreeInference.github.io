 * See also the [blogpost](https://vdeborto.github.io/publication/schrodinger_bridge/)
 * Theoretical guarantees on classical score-matching methods
 * Approximate solution to the Schrodinger bridge problem using score-based methods + repeated reverse diffusions (IPF)
 * Reduces number of steps in score based generative modeling
 * Enables OT in high dimension e.g. images
